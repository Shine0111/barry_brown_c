Array of 20 doubles, called ages:
    double ages[20];

    Indexed 0 to (array length - 1);

Array of 50 blaps, called bloop:
    blap bloop[50]; //blaps don't exist but we can create a type called blap -> typedef int blap;

Array of 1000 pixels, called img: 
    pixel img[1000];

Assign the number 18 to element 0 of ages: 

    ages[0] = 18;

Copy element 0 into element 5 of ages:

    ages[5] = ages[0];


* We don't have .length in C; so the programer should keep track of the length of the array they created (e.g: define a const ).
*C does not prevent you from accessing elements of the array that doesn't exist.

* random() will pick a number between 0 and 2 billion smthg,

* "Standard" way to make a large number smaller: 
    largeNum % 10 --> 0..9 
    largeNum % 100 --> 0..100
    largeNum % 10 + 1 --> 1..10
    largeNum % 14 - 3 --> -3..10 [ 14: the total number of value I want, 3: offset by 3]
    (Use modulo to get remainder)
