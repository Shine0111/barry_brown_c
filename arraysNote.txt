Array of 20 doubles, called ages:
    double ages[20];

    Indexed 0 to (array length - 1);

Array of 50 blaps, called bloop:
    blap bloop[50]; //blaps don't exist but we can create a type called blap -> typedef int blap;

Array of 1000 pixels, called img: 
    pixel img[1000];

Assign the number 18 to element 0 of ages: 

    ages[0] = 18;

Copy element 0 into element 5 of ages:

    ages[5] = ages[0];


* We don't have .length in C; so the programer should keep track of the length of the array they created (e.g: define a const ).
*C does not prevent you from accessing elements of the array that doesn't exist.
